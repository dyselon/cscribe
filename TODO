CLEANUP EXPORTING
- Project-save export names, export attributes
- Fix export selected to use category as datacontext/bind stuff appropriately
- ExportAll example filename should show correctly on window open
- Exports should have a default location.
- Exports location browse should also have a default location (and save the last location if possible)

OTHER USABILITY
- Try to pull logic out from main window (sort of done)
- Better UI for Google/net stuff, so there isn't long pauses with unresponsive UI - some sort of hourglass or whatever.
- Google log in window should work if you press enter anywhere on it.
- Fail gracefully if .xaml loading fails. Fail gracefully elsewhere, for that matter.
- Fix UI Stretching with long filenames in category config
- Find out why card list stretches off bottom of dock
- Make importing data/opening a project select the first tab if one isn't already selected.
- Set an icon

PYTHON
- Switch Options from dict -> array of tuples
- Let python set display name, export name
- Option to skip rest of python errors. Also, more readable, if possible...
- Get rid of "Script Options" header if there aren't any

BUGS AND PENDING GOTCHAS
- Serializing options w/ line breaks...

REFACTOR
Clean up Worksheet/GoogleWorksheetReader/CardSet entanglement - Either CardSet and Worksheet know about google/excel, or they don't. Also, why does Worksheet exist, when Excel doesn't use it? Should it?
