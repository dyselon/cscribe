- Better UI for Google/net stuff, so there isn't long pauses with unresponsive UI - some sort of hourglass or whatever.
- Fail gracefully if .xaml loading fails. Fail gracefully elsewhere, for that matter.
- Fix UI Stretching with long filenames in category config
- .py - Switch Options from dict -> array of tuples

BUGS AND PENDING GOTCHAS
