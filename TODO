FIX PRINTING
- Remove requirement of "count" column. Add dialog that asks # per card OR reads from a field
- Fix # of cards on page
- try and remove extra print dialog
- Print All

CLEANUP EXPORTING
Project-save export names, export attributes
Fix export selected to use category as datacontext/bind stuff appropriately
ExportAll example filename should show correctly on window open
Exports should have a default location.
Exports location browse should also have a default location (and save the last location if possible)

OTHER USABILITY
- Try to pull logic out from main window (sort of done)
- Better UI for Google/net stuff, so there isn't long pauses with unresponsive UI - some sort of hourglass or whatever.
- Google log in window should work if you press enter anywhere on it.
- Fail gracefully if .xaml loading fails. Fail gracefully elsewhere, for that matter.
- Fix UI Stretching with long filenames in category config
- .py - Switch Options from dict -> array of tuples
- .py - Let python set display name, export name
- .py - Option to skip rest of python errors. Also, more readable, if possible...

BUGS AND PENDING GOTCHAS
- Serializing options w/ line breaks...
- Fix UI Stretching with long filenames in category config

REFACTOR
Clean up Worksheet/GoogleWorksheetReader/CardSet entanglement - Either CardSet and Worksheet know about google/excel, or they don't. Also, why does Worksheet exist, when Excel doesn't use it? Should it?
