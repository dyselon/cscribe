FIX PRINTING
- Remove requirement of "count" column. Add dialog that asks # per card OR reads from a field
- Fix # of cards on page
- try and remove extra print dialog
- Print All

PROJECT SETTINGS
- Remember data source. Be able to refresh data from that source.
- Remember tabs, as well as per-tab options, including:
  - .xaml layout
  - python script
  - python options
  - printing options

CLEANUP EXPORTING
Directory selection for saving out images
Images should be named inteligently. Prompt for prefix?

OTHER USABILITY
Reloading .xaml should actually work.
Try to pull logic out from main window (sort of done)
Config tab? Can automate applying python, setup image dictionaries? Project files, maybe?
Close-able/reload-able tabs?
Better UI for Google/net stuff, so there isn't long pauses with unresponsive UI - some sort of hourglass or whatever.
What happens when you import data more than once?
Fail gracefully if .xaml loading fails. Fail gracefully elsewhere, for that matter.
Fix UI Stretching with long filenames in category config

BUGS AND PENDING GOTCHAS
- Serializing options w/ line breaks...

REFACTOR
Clean up Worksheet/GoogleWorksheetReader/CardSet entanglement - Either CardSet and Worksheet know about google/excel, or they don't. Also, why does Worksheet exist, when Excel doesn't use it? Should it?

FEATURE WISHLIST
Export to OCTGN?
.csv import?
Import from google drive .gsheet files
